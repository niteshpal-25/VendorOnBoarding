# VendorOnboarding

The VendorOnboarding project is a web application designed to manage vendor-related processes efficiently. It allows users to assign orders to vendors, track material delivery, and rate vendors based on their performance. Additionally, the system enables the identification of the best vendors for specific locations by analyzing ratings and delivery data. This project leverages a structured database and API endpoints to streamline vendor onboarding and evaluation.
